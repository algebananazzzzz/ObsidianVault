## Antennas

| Omnidirectional                                           | Directional                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Radiates equally in all directions                        | Focuses energy in one main direction         |
| Low gain (0–6 dBi)                                        | High gain (8–30+ dBi)                        |
| Short to medium range<br>More susceptible to interference | Long range<br>Less interference outside beam |

higher $f$ → lower $\lambda$ (size of antenna)
lower $f$ → usually longer range

## Antenna gain

Dimensionless quantity that measures the ability of an antenna to direct or receive radio waves in a particular direction compared to a reference. It is usually measured in decibels (dB)

**Antennas are reciprocal in nature. Transmit and receive equally well**

Higher the gain, more directional is the transmission and reception, and the narrower would be the beam

$$
G = \frac{4\pi A_e}{\lambda^2} = \frac{4\pi f^2 A_e}{c^2}
$$
 - G = antenna gain
 - Ae = effective area
 - f = carrier frequency
 - c = speed of light 3 X 108 m/s
 - Lambda = wavelength


Attenuation: Means loss of energy
• When signal traverses through a medium, it loses energy.
Gain: Means increase in energy
• Often devices such as amplifiers are employed to improve the signal strength
• Commonly, we use decibel to calculate gain or loss/attenuation of signal
