### Why ByteDance?
- In GovTech, our teams are small, quite isolated, our scale is just whole of government
- I don't really feel the challenge to think of new innovations to improve things
- We mainly just use existing PaaS solutions like AWS 
- I believe Bytedance have our own in-house solution, similar to how i have my own home lab to try out experimental stuff but in a much much greater scale of course
- This will be a great challenge for me to put on a hat to become someone greater
- This is the technical motivation
- On top of that, I really look up to the people in bytedance
- I remember back in 2022, while looking at the tiktok ceo debating us congress, I was like in awe of how shou manage to handle all the questionable questions so composely
- I'll definitely not be able to do that. But since then, I realized how bytedance and tiktok kinda transcend the products we create, everyone works with so much efficiency and high standards
- Want to be a part of that

### Conflict Resolution
- Create a synthetic monitoring system for 5000 government services
- In my devops team, came up with 2 architecture, developer team came up with another
- Went back and forth arguing for 3 weeks
- Focused on two main things: documentation and requirements
- Gather business requirements and technical requirements



- How big is a team size usually in Bytedance
