## Sections & Key Theses
### [[#Why Horror Film — Sensation, Repression, Transgression|Why Horror Film — Sensation, Repression, Transgression]]

# Why Horror Film — Sensation, Repression, Transgression
Horror responds to the emotional, sensory, and psychological needs created by modernity’s orderliness and routine. It provides a structured encounter with fear and taboo that is socially permitted because of its fictional framing.

## Sensation-Seeking
Modernity produces regulated, low-intensity daily life. Horror introduces controlled danger.
- Delivers adrenaline, fear, shock, disgust without real risk
- Younger viewers use horror to test their emotional limits
- Group viewing becomes social performance (bravery, taste, daring)

## Repression & the Uncanny
Freud’s uncanny: frightening because familiar.
- Horror externalises repressed desires and anxieties
- Confronts impulses that cannot be openly expressed (rage, hostility, sexual fear)
- Narrative resolution produces catharsis: the monster’s defeat symbolically expels repressed material

## Acceptable Transgression
Horror permits audiences to witness or vicariously enact taboo behaviour.
- Violence, gore, obscenity, profanation, rule-breaking
- Offers a culturally sanctioned space for deviance
- Ends by restoring order, reinforcing boundaries

## Cinematic Techniques
Film delivers horror through:
- Sound and silence (heartbeat-like bass, whispers)
- Lighting, shadow, negative space
- Point-of-view shots increasing identification with victim or monster
- Editing rhythm manipulating dread or shock
Cinema produces **affective horror**—felt physically regardless of belief.

# The Monstrous-Feminine — Psychoanalysis, Abjection, Patriarchy
Female monsters in horror are dense symbolic figures shaped by psychoanalytic theory, gender ideology, and cultural fears.

## Abjection (Kristeva)
Abjection destabilises identity and social purity.
- Bodily fluids, blood, wounds, decay
- Maternal body blurring self/other boundaries
- Horror visualises abject materials to trigger a visceral response
The monstrous-feminine often inhabits this zone of contamination and threat.

## The Monstrous-Feminine (Creed)
Creed argues the female monster represents patriarchal anxieties:
- Vagina dentata → fear of castration, loss of male potency
- Archaic mother → engulfment, loss of boundaries and autonomy
- Excessive sexuality → destabilises moral and social order
- Bodily leakage → menstrual blood, pregnancy, fluids coded as impure

Horror films operate like rituals:
- Summon the abject woman
- Let her destabilise order
- Kill/exorcise/domesticate her to restore patriarchy

## Why the Monster Is Female
Patriarchal societies associate women with:
- Messiness (blood, reproduction)
- Desire (seduction, temptation)
- Weak boundaries (emotion, body)
- Moral policing (the “good” vs “bad” woman)
Female monsters become scapegoats for broader anxieties—making gender a vessel for political and social fears.

# National Anxiety in Singapore Cinema (Tan)
Tan argues female monsters in Singaporean films embody **national anxieties**, not merely gendered ones. Because Singapore is:
- Postcolonial
- Hyper-modern
- Technocratic
- Surrounded by “less developed” neighbours
- Dependent on global flows (labour, capital, talent)

The monstrous-feminine becomes a site to negotiate:
- Fear of regional regression
- Shame or denial of Southeast Asian ancestry
- Dependence on cheap migrant labour
- Uneven relation to the West
- Fragile national masculinity

Gendered horror becomes political allegory.

# Return to Pontianak — Southeast Asia as the Abject Mother
*(Concise film analysis, deeper theory retained)*

## Southeast Asia as Maternal Origin & Threat
The Bornean jungle is:
- Dark, wet, fecund → coded as feminised
- Ungovernable, pre-modern → contrast to Singapore’s rational order
- Source of birth and danger → archaic mother (Kristeva)
Singapore’s denied regional origins return as haunting.

## Racialised Fear of Regression
Characters embody urban, global-modern Singapore.
- Their tools (GPS, phones, torches) fail
- Their scepticism toward ritual/endemic knowledge is punished
The pontianak becomes a racialised figure: Malayness/Southeast Asia as mystical, dangerous, unassimilable.

## Pontianak as National Allegory
She is:
- A castrating feminine force
- Charity’s lost mother → representing rejected ancestry
- Return of the repressed regional identity
Her violence dramatises the fear that Singapore’s modernity is fragile, easily undone by its past.

# The Maid — Migrant Labour, Guilt, and Patriarchal Violence
*(Concise film analysis, deep theoretical integration)*

## FDWs as Embodied National Anxiety
FDWs are essential yet socially marginal.
- Singaporeans rely on cheap Southeast Asian labour
- Feel guilt and fear simultaneously
- FDWs inhabit intimate domestic space → intrusion into private life

## Ghost as Moral Reckoning
Esther is raped and murdered by the employer family.
- Violence is gendered (rape), classed (FDW), and silenced (cover-up)
- The ghost exposes what the household suppresses
- Rosa becomes a potential repetition of Esther’s fate

## Exporting Guilt
Both Esther (as ghost) and Rosa (alive) ultimately return to the Philippines.
- Singapore symbolically purges guilt
- The supernatural resolves violence temporarily but leaves systems intact
- Patriarchal structure restored once foreign women exit the space

---

# Tiger’s Whip — Castration Anxiety, Foreign Talent, East–West Identity
*(Concise film analysis, high-level theoretical interpretation)*

## Western Masculinity as Threat
Dick Winner embodies:
- Western decadence
- Cultural arrogance
- Hyper-masculinity
He represents Western dominance over Asia.

## Castration Anxiety as National Metaphor
Maria’s possession by the castrated tiger allows:
- Symbolic revenge on the West
- Inversion of colonial power: the Western male becomes vulnerable
- Assertion of Asian potency over Western threat

## Identity Schizophrenia
Singapore’s hybrid identity:
- Westernised economy
- Asian-values ideology
- Dependence on foreign talent
Maria’s violent shifts dramatise this unstable mix.

## Domestication of the Monster
Maria is neutralised through marriage and exile.
- Female agency removed
- National order restored
- West–East tension symbolically resolved

---

# Horror, Ethics, and Moral Boundaries
Horror maps the limits of social norms by:
- Exposing what society represses (sex, class violence, racial tension)
- Transforming anxieties into monsters
- Destroying or exiling the monster to restore order

Singaporean horror reveals:
- Ambivalence about modernity
- Fragility of national identity
- Dependency and guilt surrounding migrant labour
- Racialised relations to the region
- Unequal relation to Western power

The monstrous-feminine reveals what Singapore fears, what it denies, and what it must continually manage through symbolic narrative containment.
