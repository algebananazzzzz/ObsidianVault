## Sections & Key Theses

### [[#Ghost Stories as Popular Culture & Social Consumption|Ghost Stories as Popular Culture & Social Consumption]]
**Thesis:** Ghost stories function as cultural commodities and modern folklore whose consumption reflects identity, group belonging, and the commodification of trauma.

### [[#Hauntings, Space, and the Memory-Laden Landscape|Hauntings, Space, and the Memory-Laden Landscape]]  
**Thesis:** Hauntings in Singapore are fundamentally spatial—ghosts anchor themselves to sites of trauma, turning urban landscapes into emotional memory-maps.

### [[#Ghost Stories as Collective Memory – Trauma, Time, Forgetting|Ghost Stories as Collective Memory – Trauma, Time, Forgetting]]  
**Thesis:** Ghost stories act as alternative archives of the Japanese Occupation, where trauma is repeated, time collapses, and selective remembering shapes national history.

### [[#Ghost Stories, Moral Boundaries, and Social Control|Ghost Stories, Moral Boundaries, and Social Control]]  
**Thesis:** Ghost stories function as moral frameworks that regulate behaviour, reinforce norms, and discipline bodies—especially in youth culture and National Service.

### [[#Faucher’s Central Contributions|Faucher’s Central Contributions]]  
**Thesis:** WWII ghosts dominate Singapore’s supernatural imagination because they allow society to emotionally process wartime trauma, navigate political silences, and reconcile modern identity with a haunted historical past.

## Ghost Stories as Popular Culture & Social Consumption

Ghost stories function as **cultural commodities**, consumed across age groups and media. They form part of everyday life, identity-making, and group belonging. The act of telling, retelling, and consuming ghost narratives embeds them into the social imagination.

Ghost stories and urban legends resemble **modern folklore**—rumour-driven, unverifiable, but widely believed because they reflect cultural anxieties, moral boundaries, and shared experiences. These narratives spread through oral stories, books, forums, TikTok, YouTube, and ghost-hunting groups.

Popular culture also **commodifies trauma**. Stories of wartime atrocities, massacres, and violence are re-packaged as entertainment, making the horrors of the past accessible, dramatic, and emotionally engaging.

**Key Examples**

- _True Singapore Ghost Stories_ (TSGS), a mass-market series blending folklore, war ghosts, and urban myths.
- SFOGS.com posts mixing “true encounters” and wartime narratives.
- TikTok and YouTube ghost tours (OCH, Punggol Beach, Pasir Ris Park).
- Taxi-driver ghost encounters framed as authentic, everyday experiences.

# **Hauntings, Space, and the Memory-Laden Landscape**

Ghosts in Singapore primarily haunt **locations** rather than individuals. Singaporean hauntings rely on the idea that **the living and the dead share the same physical space**, especially in places marked by trauma, violence, or rupture.

Faucher emphasises that haunted locations become **performance spaces for feeling history**. People visit with the expectation of encountering fear, sorrow, or the “residue” of past events. The haunting happens both through the encounter and through anticipation.

Singapore’s rapid urban redevelopment demolishes buildings but not memories. Even newly built “clean” sites can become haunted if they sit atop tragedy. This reveals that in a landscape where physical markers often disappear, ghost stories preserve spatial memory that architecture no longer provides.

**Key Examples**

- **Alexandra Hospital** — reenacted sounds of gunshots and women begging for mercy; ghosts of doctors/nurses continuing rounds.
- **Punggol Beach** — Sook Ching executions; visitors report “ghostly orbs” and eerie ambience.
- **Old Changi Hospital** — shadows, crying, and torture-room hauntings tied to kempeitai history.
- **Kent Ridge Park** — Malay Regiment ghosts; rare Malay wartime spectral presence.
- **Novena MRT** built on an exhumed Jewish cemetery, leading to haunting rumours.

# **Ghost Stories as Collective Memory: Trauma, Time, and Forgetting**

Ghost stories are powerful instruments of **collective memory**, especially for events that cannot be easily narrated through official channels. They act as **alternative emotional archives**.

### 1. Trauma and Repetition

Faucher argues that Singaporean ghost stories overwhelmingly centre the Japanese Occupation because it is constructed as the nation’s foundational trauma. Stories entangle brutal historical facts with supernatural encounters. The supernatural often feels safer than the real history:

- In one story, a family’s rape and massacre is described in graphic detail; the ghosts that appear afterwards are frightening but strangely reassuring because they cannot harm.
- The haunting allows readers to confront trauma indirectly.

Ghost stories collapse past and present. Visitors to haunted sites often describe experiences “as if the war never ended”. This sense of **temporal collapse** makes haunting an active form of memory.

### 2 Selective Remembering

Ghost stories reproduce a very **selective historical memory** aligned with state narratives:

- WWII ghosts dominate.
- Ethnic riots and Konfrontasi produce no well-known specters.
- Indian and Gurkha soldiers—key parts of British forces—are almost entirely absent.
- Malay ghosts appear mainly in contexts of heroism (Malay Regiment).

This asymmetry reveals how ghost stories reinforce accepted and “safe” national narratives while obscuring more politically sensitive histories.

### 3. Emotional Validation

Memory is sustained by **emotion**, not historical accuracy. Visitors speak of:

- chills,
- trembling,
- vibrating ground,
- distant cries,
- whispers,
- marching footsteps.

These emotions create “points de repère” (Halbwachs)—anchors that keep historical memory alive. The ghost serves as a symbolic marker of past suffering.

**Key Examples**

- Soldiers at Tekong hearing Japanese commands at 3am.
- Students at Ford Factory assuming the site must be haunted because of textbook memory.
- Alexandra Hospital nurses reenacting pre-massacre routines—“they don’t know they’re dead”.

# **Ghost Stories, Moral Boundaries, and Social Control**

Ghost stories function as **moral frameworks**, signaling what is safe, dangerous, forbidden, or acceptable. They shape everyday behavior, reinforce social norms, and define spatial boundaries.

Many stories warn against taboo behavior: wandering at night, entering certain parks or reservoirs, engaging in sexual impropriety, defying elders, or ignoring ritual obligations.

Within National Service (NS), ghost stories serve a distinct disciplinary function. Recruits are told that seeing ghosts reflects moral weakness or fearfulness; mental clarity protects them. This transforms ghost lore into psychological training.

Youth counteract these moral boundaries by actively seeking ghosts—turning transgression into thrill and bonding. This form of consumption reflects generational shifts and the “coolness” of the supernatural as a cultural aesthetic.

**Key Examples**

- Pontianak hauntings in parks policing sexual behaviour.
- Tekong ghost stories reinforcing vigilance and discipline.
- Reservoir and beach hauntings discouraging unsafe night activities.
- OCH visitations as acts of youthful rebellion.

# Faucher’s Central Contributions

1. **Ghost stories = emotional archives of war trauma**
   They make the brutality of the Japanese Occupation narratable through the supernatural, offering psychological distance and an affective form of remembering.
2. **Ghosts collapse historical time**
   Haunting produces a sense of temporal simultaneity—recruits and visitors feel as if they have slipped into 1942.
3. **Historical memory is selective and politically shaped**
   Wartime ghosts dominate; other significant historical violence is absent.  Ghost stories follow the contours of acceptable national memory.
4. **Haunted sites are performance spaces**
   People visit expecting emotional impact. The haunting starts through anticipation; emotion is the primary medium of memory.
5. **Mediation between “WWII Japan” and “J-pop Japan”**
   Ghost stories preserve the image of wartime Japanese soldiers as monstrous or cruel, while allowing modern youths to indulge in a completely separate, attractive “Japan”—anime, boy bands, kawaii culture.
6. **Ghost stories reinforce moral and disciplinary structures**
   They regulate behaviour in civilian and military contexts, shaping fear, caution, and obedience.
7. **The supernatural is often less frightening than history itself**
   Ghosts give form to horrors that might be too unbearable to confront directly.
