# Message Authentication Code (MAC)
### Cryptographic Hash function
- Must be **computationally infeasible** to find any two different messages `x` and `y` such that $H(x)=H(y)$.
- Generates **digests** (fixed length) outputs.
- Hashing the same input twice → **same** hash value (unlike encryption).
- **MD5**, **SHA-1** are **cryptographically broken**, replaced by **SHA-2** and **SHA-3**.
## Message Authentication Code
Sending $(m,H(m))$ solely does not guarantee **integrity** as attacker can replace with $(m',H(m'))$.

**Solution:**
- Sender and receiver share an **"authentication key"** `s`, exchanged confidentially.
- Send $(m,H(m+s))$, where $H(m+s)$ is the **MAC**.

## Digital Signature
Signature must be
1. **Verifiable:** Recipient can verify message is generated by sender.
2. **Unforgeable:** Only the sender can generate the signature and message.

**Solution:**
- Sender sends digitally signed message to receiver: $K^-_{s}(m)$.
- Receiver decrypts with public key: $K^+_{s}(K^-_{s}(m))=m$.
- To optimize sending long message, use fixed sized message digest `H(m)`.

**Added Guarantee:**
- **Non-repudiation:** sender cannot later deny (repudiate) sending a signed message.
